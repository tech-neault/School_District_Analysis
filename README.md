# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this project, we're helping Maria and the School Board by providing an overview of the District's data with a focus on several metrics. By mapping and analyzing these metrics, we can get further insights into how the math and reading scores of different schools are related to other metrics of interest, like school size, spending, and type. Additionally, we can help the District by isolating 9th grade math and reading testing scores from one particular school - Thomas High School - and analyzing how their potential lack of integrity impacts the rest of the District.
