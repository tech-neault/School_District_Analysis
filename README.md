# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In this project, we're helping Maria and the School Board by providing an overview of the District's data with a focus on several metrics. By mapping and analyzing these metrics, we can get further insights into how the math and reading scores of different schools are related to other metrics of interest, like school size, spending, and type. Additionally, we can help the District by isolating 9th grade math and reading testing scores from one particular school - Thomas High School - and analyzing how their potential lack of integrity impacts the rest of the District.

## Summary
After analyzing data first with and then without Thomas High School 9th graders' testing results, we found that the most noticeable change was in the 9th grade values in the overall school summary. At Thomas HS, a decrease by nearly 30 percentage points was found in both the reading and math scores. Other metrics we investigated were not as heavily impacted and showed minimal change. 

Ultimately, we would recommend an investigation into the testing score situation with the Thomas High School 9th grade class.
